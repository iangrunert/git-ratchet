# git-ratchet
git-ratchet is a tool for building ratcheted builds. Ratcheted builds are builds that go *red* when a given measure increases.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/iangrunert/git-ratchet.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/iangrunert/git-ratchet)

## What's it for?
Ratcheted builds are for teams that would like to pay off technical debt or tackle larger architectural changes to a code base over a medium-to-long term time period. Let's dive into a few examples.

Perhaps you are working on a large legacy Javascript codebase, which you would like to run jshint on. The number of warnings raised by jshint is large enough that you can't tackle them in a single day, but you'd like to avoid increasing the number of warnings when writing new features. You could set up a ratcheted build measuring the number of jshint warnings, and tackle them with small improvements over time.

Or perhaps you are attempting to perform a library upgrade, but there are a large number of usages of a deprecated method call that need to be refactored. The refactoring isn't straight-forward and can't be easily automated. You could set up a ratcheted build measuring the number of usages of the deprecated method, and tackle them with small improvements over time.

## How do I get started?

Download the [latest official release](https://github.com/iangrunert/git-ratchet/releases/latest) for your platform.

Rename the binary to git-ratchet, put it on your $PATH, and make it executable.

Run ```git ratchet check -w``` on a CI server, on your master branch.

Feed in input that looks like this:

```
_measure_,_value_
...
```

It then checks the measurements against previous values stored in your git repository, and returns a non-zero exit code if the measures have increased. Otherwise, it stores the measures againt the current commit hash and exits.

> Note: If you're feeding measures via stdin in a terminal window (likely while testing), you'll need to send `^D` to signify the end of input. [See this StackOverflow answer for a longer explanation](http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/16333/how-to-signal-the-end-of-stdin-input-in-bash)
>
> Another option would be to put measures into a file and feed that to `git-ratchet`.
```
touch measures.csv
echo "test,100" > measures.csv
git ratchet check -v -w < measures.csv
```

## How do I check my changes locally?

Run ```git ratchet check``` locally, feeding in the calculated input. This checks the measures against previous values but does not write the new values if they are okay.

## How do I see the trend over time?

Run ```git ratchet dump``` to dump a data file containing the data. This file current is currently in CSV, and looks like this:

```
Time,Measure,Value,Baseline
_timestamp_,_measure_,_value_,_baseline_
...
```

## It's 2am and I need to release a hotfix to PROD. How do I ignore the increase?

Run ```git ratchet excuse -n "_measure_" -e "It's 2am and the servers are on fire."``` locally to write an excuse. This will allow the build to pass.

## Where is the data stored?

The data is stored inside git-notes. This means this data follows around your repository, and can keep track of history, without having to pollute your working directory or commit graph.
